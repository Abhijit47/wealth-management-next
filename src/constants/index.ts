      `Without a doubt, equity is the best method for accumulating wealth. Almost every investment portfolio needs stocks.`,
      `Due to increased demand and advancements in trading technology, it is now extremely simple for anyone to transact.
      Opening a Demat Account provides numerous advantages, including the elimination of the need to preserve physical documents, the saving of time, and the ability for investors and traders to track their portfolio on a regular basis.`,
      `During the earlier days shares/stocks were kept in physical form. This made it impossible for investors to preserve the physical documents for an indefinite period of time.`,
      `The introduction of the DEMAT account made it possible for investors and traders to trade instantaneously and hold shares for as long as they desired.`,
      `Historically, Investments in equities has offered higher real returns compared to fixed income products. Hence, it is seen as good hedge against inflation.`,

      `Most investors start with unrealistic expectations about risk and return. Unrealistic expectations can quickly become unfulfilled expectations and unfulfilled expectations tend to cause grief for all concerned. There is often a gap between the level of risk which a client would normally choose to take, their risk tolerance, and the risk associated with the return required to achieve their goals. profiling is a process for finding the optimal level of investment risk for your client by balancing their risk required, risk capacity and their individual risk tolerance. There is often a mismatch between risk required, capacity and tolerance.`,
